# Money Psychology Experiment
*(Main python script is hidden due to UCL policy but can be shared on request)*

**Overview**

This programme allows the user to partake in an experiment evaluating how exposure to symbols of money change the way they behave. 
* The user clicks through screens which invite them to answer questions and complete tasks. 
* If the user is in the experiment group, they are exposed to symbols of money during the experiment. If they are in the control group, they are not.
* At the end of the experiment, the participant's results are automatically appended to a single results csv. 
* A detailed explanation of the psychology experiment is in the "READ ME" file in "Money_experiment GIT".
* Python back end with PyQT GUI

**How to Run**

1. Set directory to this folder
2. Run "RUN ME_main.py" file in python which will open the GUI (this file is available on request).

*RUN ME.py is the only file you need to interact with to run this programme; the rest of the files are linked via this script
